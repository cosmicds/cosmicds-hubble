        This was a <strong>huge</strong> deal in 1929. This relationship that Hubble found serves as evidence that we live in an <strong>expanding universe</strong>. Hubble realized that an expanding universe implies that at some point all the galaxies were much closer together â€” "<strong>The Big Bang</strong>". The amount of time since The Big Bang tells us the <strong>age of the universe</strong>.
