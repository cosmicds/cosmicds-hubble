                    The range you pick will have a tradeoff between how likely it is that the “true” value actually lies within the range you choose vs. having a narrow enough range that your measurement is actually useful. A very large range is more likely to include the "true" value, but may be so nonspecific that it is not useful. A narrow range has more specificity but may not include the "true" value.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Different people will feel more or less comfortable with the different sides of this tradeoff, and there isn’t really a right or wrong answer as long as you justify why you chose what you did.
                  </p>

                    If you are feeling really stuck, feel free to discuss this with a classmate or your instructor.
